***On the applications of the line segment intersection:***
The problem of line segment intersection has several applications in a wide range of domains, making it an important subject in computational geometry.
It is used in computer graphics to determine the visibility of objects and display complicated scenes, as well as in image processing to identify overlapping components or collision detection.
When evaluating geographical data, such as road networks or borders, geographic information systems (GIS) benefit from line segment intersection methods.
These algorithms aid pathfinding and obstacle avoidance in robotics and autonomous vehicles by giving critical information about impending collisions.
Moreover, the line segment intersection problem has implications in domains such as VLSI design, where the architecture of integrated circuits is optimised,
and computational biology, where DNA sequences or protein structures are compared and analyzed.
Overall, effective methods for solving the line segment intersection problem are vital in a variety of scientific and practical applications.



***The sweep line algorithm summarised in several sentences:***
A sweep line algorithm effectively analyses and resolves issues involving geometrical objects like points, line segments, or polygons.
It works by imitating the horizontal movement of a vertical line (the sweep line),
while retaining and updating a data structure with pertinent details about the geometrical objects intersecting the sweep line.
By focusing on the objects that are close to the sweep line, this method simplifies the problem and makes it easier to solve difficult issues like
line segment crossings, Voronoi diagrams, and convex hulls.

The time complexity of the sweep line algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the number of line segments or points.
